Things that we want our project to be able to do:

•	Should be portable, because no one really wants to play tic tac toe unless you're in class.
•	Should have a decent battery life - justification would be that given certain power sources we can afford the battery to last a certain amount of time. 
•	Should be able to go back and forth between players in a quick fashion, no big delays.
•	Able to tell if someone wins (three LEDS are lit up in a row).
•	Should be safe in terms of not shocking people when they're holding it - unless we want to shock the loser or something.
•	Should be able to display user input accurately - at least most of the time. 
•	LEDS should have enough power to display the user's choice throughout the course of the game-that way the user can be able to see what choices bring them closer to victory. 
•	After winning, the LEDS should be able to reset theoretically


Here are some of the requirements that I came up with:

The system should be able to receive user input and display it correctly in no more than 2 seconds. 
•	Justification: Previous simulations of the product dictate that this is a reasonable amount of time for the system.   Marketing Requirement(s) 2

The system should not exceed certain dimensions (fit the 3 x 3 matrix of LEDS)
•	Justification: These dimensions provide a reasonable amount of space to use the system, while not being overbearing large. Marketing Requirement(s) 1,3

The system should be able to distinguish between the input of the two users 95% of the time. 
•	Justification: 


 




Marketing Requrements:

1. Portable 
2. Fast Access Time
3. Should be Easy to Use
